# Fault Detection in Mechanical Systems Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project aims to predict electrical failures in transmission wires using machine learning models. By analyzing training data from SIMLUINK we can create a 100% detection accuracy ML model within 20 ms of fault inception time.
